Eighth Period is an integral part of the TJ school day.  It is an opportunity for students to get academic support,  explore a new interest, pursue a passion, or socialize with friends in a supervised activity. Students may decide to participate in the same clubs or activities on a regular basis, or participate in a wide variety.<br>

We offer many of the same activities and clubs that a traditional school offers, as well as some that can only be offered because of the unique technical laboratories and nature of the school.<br>

In 2017-18, there are more than 180 clubs and activities.  While there also exist clubs that involve technology and robotics, the following nine activities are primarily computing focused.  <br>

## Clubs

**Coding Lady Colonials**<br>

**Competitive Computing Teams**<br><br>
*Freshman Computing Team*
> The Frosh 'Puter Team's purpose is to promote problem-solving skills with computers and to participate in the American Computer Science League competitions and other computer contests.<br>

*Intermediate Computing Team*
> ICT's objective is to practice and enhance problem-solving skills involving programming.  Team members compete in several contests, including USACO, Topcoder, and ACM on the national/international level.

*Senior Computing Team*
> SCT's objective is to practice and enhance problem-solving skills in programming. We focus on theoretical computer science concepts involving algorithms and data structures, convering topics ranging from dynamic programming to binary indexed trees. SCT competes in several contests, including USACO and Codeforecs, on the national and international level.

**[Computer Security Club](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/csc/)**  
> CSC is designed to introduce students to and pique their interests in a field which is readily gaining importance in an increasingly   technology-dependent world. Most 8th period blocks are lectures on security topics chosen by club attendees. Occasionally, blocks may  be spent participating in CTFs, watching relevant videos, or listening to guest speakers. 

**Computer Vision Club**<br>

**Dev Club**<br>
> Dev Club discusses web development from front end to back end and holds occasional internal contests to show off studentsâ€™ applications.

**[Machine Learning Club](http://tjmachinelearning.com)**
> TJ Machine Learning Club explores machine learning and artificial intelligence, covering topics from decision trees to reinforcement learning. We also hold weekly competitions using real-world data and as a community outreach program, support ML research at TJ. All our lectures, presentation, sample code, and competitions are free for anyone to use on our website.

**Mobile Apps Club**<br>

**Sys Admins**<br>
