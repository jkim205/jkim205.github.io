<h2> Import files </h2>

<p>We have been using data sets already stored as R objects. A data scientist will rarely have such luck and will have to import data into R from either a file, a database, or other sources. Currently, one of the most common ways of storing and sharing data for analysis is through electronic spreadsheets. A spreadsheet stores data in rows and columns. It is basically a file version of a data frame. When saving such a table to a computer file, one needs a way to define when a new row or column ends and the other begins. This in turn defines the cells in which single values are stored.</p>
<p>When creating spreadsheets with text files, like the ones created with a simple text editor, a new row is defined with return and columns are separated with some predefined special character. The most common characters are comma (<code>,</code>), semicolon (<code>;</code>), space (<code>`) and tab (</code> <code>or</code>`, a preset number of spaces). Here is an example of what a comma separated file looks like if we open it with a basic text editor:</p>
<p><img src="R/img/csv-file.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The first row contains column names rather than data. We call this a <em>header</em>, and when we read-in data from a spreadsheet it is important to know if the file has a header or not. Most reading functions assume there is a header. To know if the file has a header, it helps to look at the file before trying to read it. This can be done with a text editor or with RStudio. In RStudio, we can do this by either opening the file in the editor or navigating to the file location, double clicking on the file and hitting <em>View File</em>.</p>
<p>However, not all spreadsheet files are in a text format. Google Sheets, which are rendered on a browser, are an example. Another example is the proprietary format used by Microsoft Excel. These canâ€™t be viewed with a text editor. Despite this, due to the widespread use of Microsoft Excel software, this format is widely used.</p>
<p>We start this chapter by describing the difference between text (ASCII), Unicode, and binary files and how this affects how we import them. We then explain the concepts of file paths and working directories, which are essential to understand to import data effectively. We then introduce the <strong>readr</strong> and <strong>readxl</strong> package and the functions that are available to import spreadsheets into R. Finally, we provide some recommendations on how to store and organize data in files. More complex challenges such as extracting data from web pages or PDF documents are left for the Data Wrangling part of the book.</p>
