      <h2>Naming a vector</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
<p>As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using. Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential. </p>

<p>In the previous exercise, we created a vector with your winnings over the week. Each vector element refers to a day of the week but it is hard to tell which element belongs to which day. It would be nice if you could show that in the vector itself. </p>

<p>You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the <code>names()</code> function. Have a look at this example:</p>

<pre><code>some_vector &lt;- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) &lt;- c("Name", "Profession")
</code></pre>

<p>This code first creates a vector <code>some_vector</code> and then gives the two elements a name. The first element is assigned the name <code>Name</code>, while the second element is labeled <code>Profession</code>. Printing the contents to the console yields following output:</p>

<pre><code>          Name     Profession 
    "John Doe" "poker player" 
</code></pre>
</div>
    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>

<ul>
<li>The code on the right names the elements in <code>poker_vector</code> with the days of the week. Add code to do the same thing for <code>roulette_vector</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

 <div data-type="hint">
<p>You can use <code>names(roulette_vector)</code> to set the names of the variable <code>roulette_vector</code>. Make sure to use the same vector with the days of the week as names. Remember that R is case sensitive!</p>
