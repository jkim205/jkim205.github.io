      <h2>Calculating total winnings (2)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
<p>Now you understand how R does arithmetic with vectors, it is time to get those Ferraris in your garage! First, you need to understand what the overall profit or loss per day of the week was. The total daily profit is the sum of the profit/loss you realized on poker per day, and the profit/loss you realized on roulette per day. </p>

<p>In R, this is just the sum of <code>roulette_vector</code> and <code>poker_vector</code>.</p>
</div>
    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>

<p>Assign to the variable <code>total_daily</code> how much you won or lost on each day in total (poker and roulette combined).</p>
    </div>
