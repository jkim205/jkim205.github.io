      <h2>A little arithmetic with matrices (2)
 </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Just like <code>2 * my_matrix</code> multiplied every element of <code>my_matrix</code> by two, <code>my_matrix1 * my_matrix2</code> creates a matrix where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in <code>my_matrix1</code> and <code>my_matrix2</code>. </p>

<p>After looking at the result of the previous exercise, big boss Lucas points out that the ticket prices went up over time. He asks to redo the analysis based on the prices you can find in <code>ticket_prices_matrix</code> (source: imagination).</p>

<p><em>Those who are familiar with matrices should note that this is not the standard matrix multiplication for which you should use <code>%*%</code> in R.</em></p>

      <h3> Instruction </h3>
      <ul>
<li>Divide <code>all_wars_matrix</code> by <code>ticket_prices_matrix</code> to get the estimated number of US and non-US visitors for the six movies. Assign the result to <code>visitors</code>.</li>

<li>From the <code>visitors</code> matrix, select the entire first column, representing the number of visitors in the US. Store this selection as <code>us_visitors</code>.</li>

<li>Calculate the average number of US visitors; print out the result.</li>
