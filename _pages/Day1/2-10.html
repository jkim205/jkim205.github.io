    <div class="description">

<p>Your hunch seemed to be right. It appears that the poker game is more your cup of tea than roulette. </p>

<p>Another possible route for investigation is your performance at the beginning of the working week compared to the end of it. You did have a couple of Margarita cocktails at the end of the week... </p>

<p>To answer that question, you only want to focus on a selection of the <code>total_vector</code>. In other words, our goal is to select specific elements of the vector. To select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, ...), you can use square brackets. Between the square brackets, you indicate what elements to select. For example, to select the first element of the vector, you type <code>poker_vector[1]</code>. To select the second element of the vector, you type <code>poker_vector[2]</code>, etc. Notice that the first element in a vector has index 1, not 0 as in many other programming languages.</p>
