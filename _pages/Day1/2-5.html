      <h2>Naming a vector (2)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
<p>If you want to become a good statistician, you have to become lazy. (If you are already lazy, chances are high you are one of those exceptional, natural-born statistical talents.)</p>

<p>In the previous exercises you probably experienced that it is boring and frustrating to type and retype information such as the days of the week. However, when you look at it from a higher perspective, there is a more efficient way to do this, namely, to assign the days of the week vector to a <strong>variable</strong>! </p>

<p>Just like you did with your poker and roulette returns, you can also create a variable that contains the days of the week. This way you can use and re-use it.</p>
</div>
    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>

<ul>
<li>A variable <code>days_vector</code> that contains the days of the week has already been created for you.</li>

<li>Use <code>days_vector</code> to set the names of <code>poker_vector</code> and <code>roulette_vector</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use <code>names(poker_vector) &lt;- days_vector</code> to set the names of the elements <code>poker_vector</code>. Do a similar thing for <code>roulette_vector</code>.</p>
