      <h2> Ordered factors </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Since <code>"Male"</code> and <code>"Female"</code> are unordered (or nominal) factor levels, R returns a warning message, telling you that the greater than operator is not meaningful. As seen before, R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors.</p>

<p>But this is not always the case! Sometimes you will also deal with factors that do have a natural ordering between its categories. If this is the case, we have to make sure that we pass this information to R...</p>

<p>Let us say that you are leading a research team of five data analysts and that you want to evaluate their performance. To do this, you track their speed, evaluate each analyst as <code>"slow"</code>, <code>"medium"</code> or <code>"fast"</code>, and save the results in <code>speed_vector</code>.</p>

</div>

    <div class="Instruction">

<p>As a first step, assign <code>speed_vector</code> a vector with 5 entries, one for each analyst. Each entry should be either <code>"slow"</code>, <code>"medium"</code>, or <code>"fast"</code>. Use the list below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analyst 1 is medium,</li>

<li>Analyst 2 is slow,</li>

<li>Analyst 3 is slow,</li>

<li>Analyst 4 is medium and</li>

<li>Analyst 5 is fast.</li>
</ul>

<p>No need to specify these are factors yet.</p>
