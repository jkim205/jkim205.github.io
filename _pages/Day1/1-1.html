    <div>
      <p>
        In the editor on the right you should type R code to solve the exercises. When you hit the 'Submit Answer' button, every line of code is interpreted and executed by R and you get a message whether or not your code was correct. The output of your R code is shown in the console in the lower right corner.</p><p>

R makes use of the <code class="w3-codespan">#</code> sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. For example, <code class="w3-codespan"> Calculate 3 + 4 </code> in the editor on the right is a comment.</p><p>

You can also execute R commands straight in the console. This is a good way to experiment with R code, as your submission is not checked for correctness.</p>

      <h3>Instruction</h3>

<p>- In the editor on the right there is already some sample code. Can you see which lines are actual R code and which are comments?</p>
<p>- Add a line of code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, and hit the 'Submit Answer' button.</p>

        Just add a line of R code that calculates the sum of 6 and 12, just like the example in the sample code!
