      <h2>Calculating total winnings (3)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">
<p>Based on the previous analysis, it looks like you had a mix of good and bad days. This is not what your ego expected, and you wonder if there may be a very tiny chance you have lost money over the week in total? </p>

<p>A function that helps you to answer this question is <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/sum"><code>sum()</code></a>. It calculates the sum of all elements of a vector. For example, to calculate the total amount of money you have lost/won with poker you do: </p>

<pre><code>total_poker &lt;- sum(poker_vector)
</code></pre>
</div>
    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>

<ul>
<li>Calculate the total amount of money that you have won/lost with roulette and assign to the variable <code>total_roulette</code>.</li>

<li>Now that you have the totals for roulette and poker, you can easily calculate <code>total_week</code> (which is the sum of all gains and losses of the week).</li>

<li>Print out <code>total_week</code>.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<p>Use the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/sum"><code>sum()</code></a> function to get the total of the <code>roulette_vector</code>. <code>total_week</code> is then the sum of <code>roulette_vector</code> and <code>poker_vector</code>.</p>
