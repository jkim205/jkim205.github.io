    <div class="description">

<p>A <strong>list</strong> in R is similar to your to-do list at work or school: the different items on that list most likely differ in length, characteristic, and type of activity that has to be done. </p>

<p>A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way.</p>

<p>You could say that a list is some kind super data type: you can store practically any piece of information in it!</p>
