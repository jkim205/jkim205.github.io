      <h2> Creating a named list (2)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Being a huge movie fan (remember your job at LucasFilms), you decide to start storing information on good movies with the help of lists. </p>

<p>Start by creating a list for the movie "The Shining". We have already created the variables <code>mov</code>, <code>act</code> and <code>rev</code> in your R workspace. Feel free to check them out in the console.</p>

</div>

    <div class="Instruction">

<h3>Instruction</h3>

<p>Complete the code on the right to create <code>shining_list</code>; it contains three elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>moviename: a character string with the movie title (stored in <code>mov</code>)</li>

<li>actors: a vector with the main actors' names (stored in <code>act</code>)</li>

<li>reviews: a data frame that contains some reviews (stored in <code>rev</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not forget to name the list components accordingly (names are moviename, actors and reviews).</p>

    </div>

    <div data-datacamp-exercise data-lang="r" data-height="auto">
      <code data-type="pre-exercise-code">

mov <- "The Shining"
act      <- c("Jack Nicholson","Shelley Duvall","Danny Lloyd","Scatman Crothers","Barry Nelson")
sources     <- c("IMDb1","IMDb2","IMDb3")
comments    <- c("Best Horror Film I Have Ever Seen","A truly brilliant and scary film from Stanley Kubrick","A masterpiece of psychological horror")
scores      <- c(4.5,4,5)
rev     <- data.frame(scores, sources, comments)
rm(scores, sources, comments)

      </code>
      <code data-type="sample-code">
# The variables mov, act and rev are available

# Finish the code to build shining_list
shining_list <- list(moviename = mov)


      </code>
      <code data-type="solution">
# The variables mov, act and rev are available

# Finish the code to build shining_list
shining_list <- list(moviename = mov, actors = act, reviews = rev)

      </code>
      <code data-type="sct">
msg = "Do not remove or change the definition of the pre-set variables!"
lapply(c("mov", "rev", "act"), test_object, undefined_msg = msg, incorrect_msg = msg)
test_object("shining_list",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `shining_list` does not contain the correct elements: the first element should be `mov`, the second element `act`, and the third `rev`.")
test_object("shining_list", eq_condition = "equal",
            incorrect_msg = "It looks like `shining_list` does not contain the correct naming for the components: name the first element `moviename`, the second element `actors`, and the third element `reviews`.");
success_msg("Wonderful! You now know how to construct and name lists. As in the previous chapters, let's look at how to select elements for lists. Head over to the next exercise")

</code>
 <div data-type="hint">

<p><code>shining_list &lt;- list(moviename = mov)</code> is only part of the solution; it's your job to also add <code>act</code> and <code>rev</code> to the list, with the appropriate names.</p>
