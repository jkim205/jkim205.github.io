      <h2> Comparing ordered factors </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Having a bad day at work, 'data analyst number two' enters your office and starts complaining that 'data analyst number five' is slowing down the entire project. Since you know that 'data analyst number two' has the reputation of being a smarty-pants, you first decide to check if his statement is true.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>factor_speed_vector</code> is now ordered enables us to compare different elements (the data analysts in this case). You can simply do this by using the well-known operators.</p>

</div>

    <div class="Instruction">

<ul>
<li>Use <code>[2]</code> to select from <code>factor_speed_vector</code> the factor value for the second data analyst. Store it as <code>da2</code>.</li>

<li>Use <code>[5]</code> to select the <code>factor_speed_vector</code> factor value for the fifth data analyst. Store it as <code>da5</code>.</li>

<li>Check if <code>da2</code> is greater than <code>da5</code>; simply print out the result. Remember that you can use the <code>&gt;</code> operator to check whether one element is larger than the other.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To select the factor value for the third data analyst, you'd need <code>factor_speed_vector[3]</code>.</li>

<li>To compare two values, you can use <code>&gt;</code>. For example: <code>da3 &gt; da4</code>.</li>
