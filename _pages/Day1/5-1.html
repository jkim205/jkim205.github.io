    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>You may remember from the chapter about matrices that all the elements that you put in a matrix should be of the same type. Back then, your data set on Star Wars only contained numeric elements. </p>

<p>When doing a market research survey, however, you often have questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>'Are you married?' or 'yes/no' questions (<code>logical</code>)</li>

<li>'How old are you?' (<code>numeric</code>)</li>

<li>'What is your opinion on this product?' or other 'open-ended' questions (<code>character</code>)</li>

<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>The output, namely the respondents' answers to the questions formulated above, is a data set of different data types. You will often find yourself working with data sets that contain different data types instead of only one. </p>

<p>A data frame has the variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows. This will be a familiar concept for those coming from different statistical software packages such as SAS or SPSS.</p>
