      <h2>A little arithmetic with matrices
 </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Similar to what you have learned with vectors, the standard operators like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>*</code>, etc. work in an element-wise way on matrices in R. </p>

<p>For example, <code>2 * my_matrix</code> multiplies each element of <code>my_matrix</code> by two.</p>

<p>As a newly-hired data analyst for Lucasfilm, it is your job to find out how many visitors went to each movie for each geographical area. You already have the total revenue figures in <code>all_wars_matrix</code>. Assume that the price of a ticket was 5 dollars. Simply dividing the box office numbers by this ticket price gives you the number of visitors.</p>
</div>

    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3> Instruction </h3>
      <ul>
<ul>
<li>Divide <code>all_wars_matrix</code> by 5, giving you the number of visitors in millions. Assign the resulting matrix to <code>visitors</code>.</li>

<li>Print out <code>visitors</code> so you can have a look.</li>
</ul>
    </div>
