      <h2> Selecting elements from a list</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Your list will often be built out of numerous elements and components. Therefore, getting a single element, multiple elements, or a component out of it is not always straightforward. </p>

<p>One way to select a component is using the numbered position of that component. For example, to "grab" the first component of <code>shining_list</code> you type </p>

<pre><code>shining_list[[1]]
</code></pre>

<p>A quick way to check this out is typing it in the console. Important to remember: to select elements from vectors, you use single square brackets: <code>[ ]</code>. Don't mix them up!</p>

<p>You can also refer to the names of the components, with <code>[[ ]]</code> or with the <code>$</code> sign. Both will select the data frame representing the reviews: </p>

<pre><code>shining_list[["reviews"]]
shining_list$reviews
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Besides selecting components, you often need to select specific elements out of these components. For example, with <code>shining_list[[2]][1]</code> you select from the second component, <code>actors</code> (<code>shining_list[[2]]</code>), the first element (<code>[1]</code>). When you type this in the console, you will see the answer is Jack Nicholson.</p>

<h3>Instruction</h3>

<ul>
<li>Select from <code>shining_list</code> the vector representing the actors. Simply print out this vector.</li>

<li>Select from <code>shining_list</code> the second element in the vector representing the actors. Do a printout like before.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To select the vector representing the actors, you can use <code>$actors</code>.</li>

<li>To select the third element in the vector representing the actors, you use <code>shining_list$actors[3]</code>. What needs to change to select the second element?</li>
