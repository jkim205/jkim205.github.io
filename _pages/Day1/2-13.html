      <h2>Vector selection: the good times (4)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Another way to tackle the previous exercise is by using the names of the vector elements (Monday, Tuesday, ...) instead of their numeric positions. For example, </p>

<pre><code>poker_vector["Monday"]
</code></pre>

<p>will select the first element of <code>poker_vector</code> since <code>"Monday"</code> is the name of that first element.</p>

<p>Just like you did in the previous exercise with numerics, you can also use the element names to select multiple elements, for example: </p>

<pre><code>poker_vector[c("Monday","Tuesday")]
</code></pre>
</div>

    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Select the first three elements in <code>poker_vector</code> by using their names: <code>"Monday"</code>, <code>"Tuesday"</code> and <code>"Wednesday"</code>. Assign the result of the selection to <code>poker_start</code>.</li>

<li>Calculate the average of the values in <code>poker_start</code> with the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/mean"><code>mean()</code></a> function. Simply print out the result so you can inspect it.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You can use <code>c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")</code> inside square brackets to subset <code>poker_vector</code> appropriately.</li>

<li>You can use <code>mean(poker_start)</code> to get the mean of the elements in <code>poker_start</code>. You do not need the mean of all poker elements, but only of the first three days.</li>
