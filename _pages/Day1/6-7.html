      <h2> Adding more movie information to the list</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Being proud of your first list, you shared it with the members of your movie hobby club. However, one of the senior members, a guy named M. McDowell, noted that you forgot to add the release year. Given your ambitions to become next year's president of the club, you decide to add this information to the list. </p>

<p>To conveniently add elements to lists you can use the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/c"><code>c()</code></a> function, that you also used to build vectors:</p>

<pre><code>ext_list &lt;- c(my_list , my_val)
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>This will simply extend the original list, <code>my_list</code>, with the component <code>my_val</code>. This component gets appended to the end of the list.
If you want to give the new list item a name, you just add the name as you did before: </p>

<pre><code>ext_list &lt;- c(my_list, my_name = my_val)
</code></pre>

</div>

    <div class="Instruction">

<h2>Instruction</h2>

<ul>
<li>Complete the code below such that an item named <code>year</code> is added to the <code>shining_list</code> with the value 1980. Assign the result to <code>shining_list_full</code>.</li>

<li>Finally, have a look at the structure of <code>shining_list_full</code> with the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/str"><code>str()</code></a> function.</li>
</ul>

test_function("str", "object", incorrect_msg = "Don't forget to display the structure of `shining_list_full` with `str()`.")

 <div data-type="hint">

<p>Have a look at the example code in the exercise assignment. Maybe this can help you start:</p>

<pre><code>shining_list &lt;- c(shining_list, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>You still have to add some code where the three dots are.</p>
