      <h2>Comparing total winnings</h2>

    <div class="description">

<p>Oops, it seems like you are losing money. Time to rethink and adapt your strategy! This will require some deeper analysis... </p>

<p>After a short brainstorm in your hotel's jacuzzi, you realize that a possible explanation might be that your skills in roulette are not as well developed as your skills in poker. So maybe your total gains in poker are higher (or <code>&gt;</code> ) than in roulette.</p>

</div>
    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>

<ul>
<li>Calculate <code>total_poker</code> and <code>total_roulette</code> as in the previous exercise. Use the <code>sum()</code> function twice.</li>

<li>Check if your total gains in poker are higher than for roulette by using a comparison. Simply print out the result of this comparison. What do you conclude, should you focus on roulette or on poker?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You partly calculated the answer to this question in the previous exercise already!</li>

<li>To check if 6 is larger than 5, you type <code>6 &gt; 5</code>. This returns a logical value (<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>).</li>
