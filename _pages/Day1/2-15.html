      <h2>Selection by comparison - Step 2</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>Working with comparisons will make your data analytical life easier. Instead of selecting a subset of days to investigate yourself (like before), you can simply ask R to return only those days where you realized a positive return for poker. </p>

<p>In the previous exercises you used <code>selection_vector &lt;- poker_vector &gt; 0</code> to find the days on which you had a positive poker return. Now, you would like to know not only the days on which you won, but also how much you won on those days. </p>

<p>You can select the desired elements, by putting <code>selection_vector</code> between the square brackets that follow <code>poker_vector</code>:</p>

<pre><code>poker_vector[selection_vector]
</code></pre>

<p>R knows what to do when you pass a logical vector in square brackets: it will only select the elements that correspond to <code>TRUE</code> in <code>selection_vector</code>.</p>

</div>
    <div class="Instruction">
      <h3>Instruction</h3>
<p>Use <code>selection_vector</code> in square brackets to assign the amounts that you won on the profitable days to the variable <code>poker_winning_days</code>.</p>
