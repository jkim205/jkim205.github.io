    </div>

    <div class="description">

<p>So what exactly did you learn in the previous exercises? You selected a subset from a data frame (<code>planets_df</code>) based on whether or not a certain condition was true (rings or no rings), and you managed to pull out all relevant data. Pretty awesome! By now, NASA is probably already flirting with your CV ;-). </p>

<p>Now, let us move up one level and use the function <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset"><code>subset()</code></a>. You should see the <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset"><code>subset()</code></a> function as a short-cut to do exactly the same as what you did in the previous exercises. </p>

<pre><code>subset(my_df, subset = some_condition)
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>The first argument of <a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/subset"><code>subset()</code></a> specifies the data set for which you want a subset. By adding the second argument, you give R the necessary information and conditions to select the correct subset. </p>

<p>The code below will give the exact same result as you got in the previous exercise, but this time, you didn't need the <code>rings_vector</code>!</p>

<pre><code>subset(planets_df, subset = rings)
</code></pre>

<p></p>

</div>

    <div class="Instruction">

<h2>Instruction</h2>

<p>Use <code>subset()</code> on <code>planets_df</code> to select planets that have a diameter smaller than Earth. Because the <code>diameter</code> variable is a relative measure of the planet's diameter w.r.t that of planet Earth, your condition is <code>diameter &lt; 1</code>.</p>

 <div data-type="hint">
<p><code>subset(planets_df, subset = ...)</code> almost solves it; can you fill in the <code>...</code>?</p>
